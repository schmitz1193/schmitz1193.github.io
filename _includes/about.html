                    <p>
                        After a detour to raise my family and a successful career in Human Resources, I am so excited to be returning to my roots as a programmer.  I recently relocated to Nashville, TN and it has been one of the best decisions of my life. Aside from the awesome people, wonderful restaurants and great music, I also discovered Nashville Software School.  NSS has provided me the foundation I needed to return to programming.  During the six month, full time program, I worked alone and colllaboratively on projects involving a pleathora of technolgies to prepare me for a career as a full stack developer.  Many of those technoloties are listed at the beginning of this website.  But I choose not to be limited.  I think life is a journey and I choose to make mine about continuing to learn, experience and share my knowledge to help others.  "You have two hands, one to help yourself the second to help others". -Unknown
